# Active technical-debt register

This document records only active, actionable technical debt. Functional
problems and missing capabilities belong to the
[product roadmap](product-roadmap.md); in particular, the profile, unit and
Quick Workout problems are not duplicated here.

## Maintenance rules

- Every entry must state impact, verifiable evidence, a solution direction and
  closure criteria.
- Debt is removed from this register when it is closed. Extensive evidence from
  closed audits is preserved in `docs/history/`.
- Product decisions are linked, never duplicated here.
- An accepted limitation is documented as context. It does not become active
  debt without new evidence that justifies prioritising it.

## Active debt

No active technical debt is currently recorded.

TD-28 and TD-29 were closed on 2026-09-07 after device confirmation; see the
document history below. Both were frontend defects with no production impact on
stored data.

<a id="td-27"></a>

TD-27 closed on 2026-09-07. See the [closure record](../history/td27-closure-2026-09-07.md) for implementation and production evidence.

## Accepted limitations

- There are no real measurements on iPhone. Desktop checks can validate ordering
  and behaviour, but they do not quantify the PWA's performance on that device.
- The suite deliberately excludes component and E2E tests: Vitest stays in a Node
  environment for pure logic, auth orchestration and API contracts. This coverage
  boundary is accepted until a concrete need justifies expanding the tooling and
  its maintenance.

## Previous audit

All 27 items from the previous audit were closed or reframed. Their full content
remains as evidence in the
[July 2026 technical audit](../history/technical-debt-audit-2026-07.md), which is
written in Spanish and kept frozen as a historical record. It must not be used as
a list of active debt.

## Document history

- **2026-09-07 (revision 5):** Closed and removed `TD-28` and `TD-29` after the
  owner confirmed all three device criteria on an iPhone: focusing an input no
  longer zooms the page, a five-character weight stays legible at 16px, and the
  completion checkbox changes colour through a real save. The register is empty
  again. Retained for future sessions, because both defects were invisible to
  every automated check this repo has: an undefined Tailwind variant emits no
  CSS and no build error, and a class override that loses a deliberate
  accessibility mitigation still type-checks and still passes lint. Grepping the
  compiled stylesheet is what found and then verified both.
- **2026-09-07 (revision 4):** Applied the fixes for both entries. `TD-29`
  dropped the `text-sm` override at the three set inputs; `TD-28` moved the
  save state onto the completion checkbox as a ring, on the owner's decision,
  and removed the last `xs:` usages. Both remain open on purpose: their
  remaining criteria are device observations, and neither can be verified from
  a build. Vitest is Node-only, so no test covers either change.
- **2026-09-07 (revision 3):** Corrected `TD-29` against a device screenshot.
  The entry had claimed the 16px fix would widen the inputs and force a
  redesign; it does not, because the columns are `flex-1` and the input is
  `w-full`, so font size changes the digits and not the box. That inverts the
  pair: `TD-29` is a three-class change, and `TD-28` is the one needing a
  design decision, because the same screenshot shows no room left for a fourth
  element in that row.
- **2026-09-07 (revision 2):** Recorded `TD-29` from a device report: focusing a
  set input zooms the page on iOS. The cause is three call sites overriding the
  16px mobile font size that `components/ui/input.tsx` already sets for exactly
  this reason, not a missing mitigation. Cross-linked to `TD-28` because both
  closure checks need the same narrow-viewport pass on the same row.
- **2026-09-07:** Recorded `TD-28` after a production-build check of the compiled
  stylesheet showed the `xs:` variant generating no CSS. Found while adding the
  RPE column for `LIVE-04`, which shares the affected row; the two are related
  only by that layout, so the breakpoint defect was left out of that change
  rather than folded into it.
- **2026-09-06:** Translated from Spanish to English so both active registers and
  the four `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` files share one language. Content is
  unchanged apart from the `DATA-01`-`DATA-05` status note and the pointer to the
  rollout runbook. A stable `td-27` anchor was added so cross-document links no
  longer depend on the heading text.
