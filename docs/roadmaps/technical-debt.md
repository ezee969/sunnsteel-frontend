# Active technical-debt register

This document records only active, actionable technical debt. Functional
problems and missing capabilities belong to the
[product roadmap](product-roadmap.md); in particular, the profile, unit and
Quick Workout problems are not duplicated here.

## Maintenance rules

- Every entry must state impact, verifiable evidence, a solution direction and
  closure criteria.
- Debt is removed from this register when it is closed. Extensive evidence from
  closed audits is preserved in `docs/history/`.
- Product decisions are linked, never duplicated here.
- An accepted limitation is documented as context. It does not become active
  debt without new evidence that justifies prioritising it.

## Active debt

No active technical debt is currently recorded.

TD-27 closed on 2026-09-07. See the [closure record](../history/td27-closure-2026-09-07.md) for implementation and production evidence.

## Accepted limitations

- There are no real measurements on iPhone. Desktop checks can validate ordering
  and behaviour, but they do not quantify the PWA's performance on that device.
- The suite deliberately excludes component and E2E tests: Vitest stays in a Node
  environment for pure logic, auth orchestration and API contracts. This coverage
  boundary is accepted until a concrete need justifies expanding the tooling and
  its maintenance.

## Previous audit

All 27 items from the previous audit were closed or reframed. Their full content
remains as evidence in the
[July 2026 technical audit](../history/technical-debt-audit-2026-07.md), which is
written in Spanish and kept frozen as a historical record. It must not be used as
a list of active debt.

## Document history

- **2026-09-06:** Translated from Spanish to English so both active registers and
  the four `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` files share one language. Content is
  unchanged apart from the `DATA-01`-`DATA-05` status note and the pointer to the
  rollout runbook. A stable `td-27` anchor was added so cross-document links no
  longer depend on the heading text.
