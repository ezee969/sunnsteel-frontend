# Frontend RtF Initial Implementation - COMPLETE âœ…

Migrated from root markdown clutter to structured history. Tracks delivery of baseline RtF UI & TM adjustment integration.

## Scope Delivered
- TM Adjustment Panel (create + list + summary)
- Program style badge & propagation
- Routine detail enhancements (conditional panel rendering)
- Type-safe API layer + hooks scaffolding

## Not Included (Deferred)
- Timeline visualization
- Forecast card
- Offline cache
- Anomaly notifications

## Next Steps
1. Implement roadmap tasks (see ../roadmaps/RTF_ENHANCEMENTS.md)
2. Introduce deterministic forecast test harness once hook lands
3. Add ETag/If-None-Match middleware to fetch layer
