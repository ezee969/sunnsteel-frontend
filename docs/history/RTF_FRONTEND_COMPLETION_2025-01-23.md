- **Data Adapter** (F03): Comprehensive normalization utilities for stats, grouping, and validation
- **ETag Caching** (F04): Advanced HTTP client with conditional requests and cache invalidation
- **Forecast Cards** (F05): Interactive predictions with confidence indicators and target week support

### Advanced Analytics (RTF-F06 to RTF-F12) ✅
- **AMRAP Performance Panel** (F06): Target vs actual tracking with trend analysis and confidence scoring
- **Weekly Trend Charts** (F07): Multi-metric visualization using Recharts (volume, intensity, AMRAP)
- **Anomaly Notifications** (F08): Smart alert system with performance recommendations and priority scoring
- **Program History Modal** (F09): Snapshot versioning system with change tracking and diff visualization
- **Offline Cache** (F10): IndexedDB implementation with TTL management and cache statistics
- **Deload Styling** (F11): Visual differentiation with ring styling and semantic color coding
- **Test Harness** (F12): Comprehensive deterministic test suite with 11 validation scenarios

### Integration Layer (RTF-F13 to RTF-F16) ✅  
- **RTF Hooks** (F13-F15): React abstractions for forecast, timeline, and week goals with ETag caching
- **Dashboard Integration** (F16): Complete 6-tab interface (Overview, Timeline, Forecast, AMRAP, Trends, Insights)
