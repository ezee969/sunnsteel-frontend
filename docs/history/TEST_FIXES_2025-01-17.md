# Test Fixes - January 17, 2025

## Summary

Fixed all failing tests after implementing the exerciseId payload fix and routine loading state improvements. All test suites now pass successfully.

## Test Results

### Backend Tests
- **Unit Tests**: ✅ 102 passed (10 test suites)
- **E2E Tests**: ✅ 76 passed, 13 skipped (21 test suites passed, 3 skipped)
- **Total**: All backend tests passing

### Frontend Tests
- **Before Fixes**: 6 failed, 402 passed (3 test files failed)
- **After Fixes**: ✅ 408 passed (51 test suites)
- **Total**: All frontend tests passing

## Changes Made

### 1. Active Session Page Tests

**Files Modified:**
- `__tests__/app/protected/workouts/sessions/active-session-page.test.tsx`
- `__tests__/app/protected/workouts/sessions/active-session-page-grouped.test.tsx`

**Changes:**
1. Added `isFetched: true` to `useRoutine` mock to match new loading logic
2. Updated `exerciseId` expectations from `'re1'` (routineExerciseId) to `'e1'` (actual exerciseId)

**Reason:**
The component now properly gates routine rendering on `isFetched` status and passes the correct per-set `exerciseId` instead of the group-level `routineExerciseId`.

### 2. Exercise Group Component Tests

**File Modified:**
- `__tests__/components/workout/exercise-group.test.tsx`

**Changes:**
1. Added `exerciseId: 'exercise-1'` field to all mock sets
2. Mock sets now include both `routineExerciseId` and `exerciseId` fields

**Reason:**
The `ExerciseGroup` component now passes `set.exerciseId` to `SetLogInput` instead of the group-level `exerciseId` prop, matching the fix for the 400 "exerciseId does not match routine exercise" error.

## Root Cause

The test failures were caused by two production code changes:

1. **Routine Loading State Fix**: Added proper loading gates using `isFetched` to prevent "Routine Not Found" flicker
2. **ExerciseId Payload Fix**: Changed `SetLogInput` to receive per-set `exerciseId` instead of group-level to fix backend validation errors

## Test Coverage

All test categories remain fully covered:
- Component rendering and interaction
- API integration and mocking
- State management and hooks
- Form validation and submission
- Loading states and error handling
- Accessibility and keyboard navigation

## Verification

Run tests with:
```bash
# Backend
cd sunnsteel-backend
npm test              # Unit tests
npm run test:e2e      # E2E tests

# Frontend
cd sunnsteel-frontend
npm test              # All tests
```
