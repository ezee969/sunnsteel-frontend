# Test Directory Consolidation

## Overview

Successfully consolidated the frontend test directories from a dual structure (`test/` and `__tests__/`) into a single, unified `__tests__/` directory structure.

## Background

The project previously had two test directories:
- `test/` - Legacy directory containing setup files, mocks, and older tests
- `__tests__/` - Newer directory with modern test files for components and hooks

This dual structure created confusion and maintenance overhead.

## Changes Made

### 1. Infrastructure Migration
- Moved `test/setup.ts` → `__tests__/setup.ts`
- Moved `test/utils.tsx` → `__tests__/utils.tsx`
- Moved `test/mocks/` → `__tests__/mocks/`
- Moved `test/types/` → `__tests__/types/`

### 2. Test File Migration
- Migrated `test/app/` → `__tests__/app/` (protected routes, dashboards, routines, workouts)
- Migrated `test/lib/` → `__tests__/lib/` (RTF, auth, workout sessions, utilities)
- Migrated `test/features/` → `__tests__/features/` (routine components, wizard, hooks)
- Migrated `test/components/` → `__tests__/components/` (UI components)

### 3. Configuration Updates
- Updated `vitest.config.ts`:
  - Changed `setupFiles` from `./test/setup.ts` to `./__tests__/setup.ts`
  - Updated exclude paths from `test/lib/api/hooks/` to `__tests__/lib/api/hooks/`

### 4. Import Path Updates
- Updated all test files to use `@/__tests__/` instead of `@/test/` for imports
- Fixed references to utilities, mocks, and types

### 5. Directory Cleanup
- Removed the empty legacy `test/` directory

## Final Structure

```
__tests__/
├── setup.ts                    # Test setup and configuration
├── utils.tsx                   # Test utilities and wrappers
├── mocks/                      # Mock data and services
├── types/                      # Test-specific type definitions
├── app/                        # Page component tests
│   └── protected/
│       ├── routines/
│       └── workouts/
├── components/                 # UI component tests
│   ├── ui/
│   └── workout/
├── features/                   # Feature-specific tests
│   └── routines/
├── hooks/                      # Custom hook tests
└── lib/                        # Library and utility tests
    └── api/
```

## Verification

- All existing tests continue to pass
- Test infrastructure (setup, mocks, utilities) works correctly
- Import paths are properly resolved
- No duplicate or orphaned test files

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Structure**: Single test directory eliminates confusion
2. **Consistent Imports**: All tests use `@/__tests__/` prefix
3. **Better Organization**: Clear separation of test types (app, components, features, hooks, lib)
4. **Easier Maintenance**: Single location for all test-related files
5. **Improved Developer Experience**: Clear test file discovery and navigation
